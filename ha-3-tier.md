# Building a highly available 3-tier web application in VPC
{: #ha-3-tier}

This reference architecture describes 3 methods of deploying a 3-tier web applicable on {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}. This information applies to most 3-tier web applications that need to be resilient and highly available applications

|Tier|Description|
|---|---|
|The front-end web tier|The 1st- tier is usually the user interaction which takes in user input and parses the data to be handed off to the next tier.
|The application tier|The 2nd-tier takes the data from the web tier to process and apply logic.  This can include writing or pulling data from the data tier and/or provides results back to the web tier.
|The data tier|The 3rd-tier stores the application data that can be in written form or query from.  The storage varies across different storage technologies such as block volumes or object storage depending on the application requirements.

## Deployment Considerations
{{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} is only offered in multizone regions (MZR) which are made up of 3 more zones.  Each zone is isolated from each other to contain failures within a zone. The zones are also interconnected with a high-speed connection for higher bandwidth and lower latency for intra-zone communications.

## Component Considerations

### Virtual Servers

Servers in each of the 3-tiers have different requirements. When you provision your virtual servers, you have multiple options for virtual server profiles: Balanced, Compute and Memory.  The vCPU to memory ratio varies across the different profiles, but within the profile the ratio is constant. Within a profile, the number of vCPU and memory increases along with the bandwidth performance. Use the following information when provisioning your servers.

|Tier|Server requirements|
|---|---|
|Front-end web tier|This tier tends to be higher in traffic workload. These workloads are more CPU-intensive than memory-intensive.  So, you will want to select a Compute profile which has a vCPU ratio to memory of 1:2. Within the Compute profile select the appropriate type based your vCPU and memory requirements.|
|Application tier|This tier tends to be more memory-intensive and involves more caching. For this workload, select a Memory profile where the ratio of vCPU to memory is more weighted to the memory, 1:8.|
|Data tier|If you are using a virtual instance as the database, select a Balance profile which offers more balance between vCPU and memory, such as 1:4.|

### Load balancers
There are 2 different types of load balancers that you can order from IBM Cloud.  While both load balancers can distribute both HTTP/HTTPS and TCP traffic, each provides different capabilities which may be more suited for different deployment types.

1. You can deploy {{site.data.keyword.loadbalancer_full}} either in public or private scenarios.  For a public scenario, the load balancer has a public interface to take incoming traffic from the internet and distribute the traffic through its private interface connecting to the virtual servers as shown [Scenario 1 - deploying in single zone](#single-zone). For a private scenario, the incoming and distributed outgoing traffic go through private subnets, such as the traffic between the application tier and the data tier.

  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.loadbalancer_short}} also provides horizontal scaling to better handle increased traffic load.  

  You can configure the {{site.data.keyword.loadbalancer_short}} back-end listener across multiple zones. When you do this, a secondary load balancer is automatically provisioned and deployed in an active-active fashion for better availability. See [Scenario 2 - deploying in multiple zones with {{site.data.keyword.cis_full_notm}}](#multi-zone-cis).

2. {{site.data.keyword.cis_full}} is a global load balancer which only acts as a public load balancer.  Typically, it is deployed for global applications across multiple regions. {{site.data.keyword.cis_short}} is geo-aware and steers the traffic to the zone that is closest to the requestor.

In [Scenario 2 - deploying in multiple zones with {{site.data.keyword.cis_full_notm}}](#multi-zone-cis), {{site.data.keyword.cis_short}} distributes traffic between zones. {{site.data.keyword.cis_short}} allows you to create multiple server pools and origins to allow 1:N type of deployment â€“ 1 application to multiple server pools and origins.  One application deployed across multiple server pools is helpful for DevOps management.

### Storage
Storage can be a virtual server with block volumes or {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}}.  If your application requires lower latency and higher IOPs, use a virtual server with block volumes.  You will need a 3rd-party tool to provide replication or snapshots.  For unstructured data and high data volumes use {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}. The {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service has different tiers where replication will vary such as within a zone, across multiple zones, or across regions. The replication is not instantaneous, but occurs over time.

### Security

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides both security groups and firewall access control lists (ACL). For host-based security, consider using security groups to preserve the firewall ACLs. Firewall ACLs are best used when applying the same security rule at a subnet level rather than at the host level.

## Scenario 1 - deploying in single zone
{: #single-zone}

Deploying your web application in only one of the three MZR zones of a VPC provides the best low latency solution because all of the services are in close proximity and contained within a single zone.

When deploying in a single zone, deploy multiple virtual instances within a tier for better availability and capacity. No load balancer is required.

This deployment type has some risk. While you will deploy multiple virtual instances, the application is not protected against a failure within a data center. which becomes a single point of failure for the application.

## Scenario 2 - deploying in multiple zones with {{site.data.keyword.cis_full_notm}}
{: #multi-zone-cis}

You can deploy your application as active-active across multiple zones using a combination of {{site.data.keyword.cis_full_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.loadbalancer_short}}. This method enables replication across multiple zones, increasing the availability of the application.  Because of the active-active deployment, more devices are available for parallel processing, improving resiliency and performance. The likelihood of simultaneous failure across multiple zones is much less likely in comparison to a single zone. If a failure occurs in one of the zones, the failure is contained in that zone.  Even though the capacity is reduced during a failure, the application is still active in the other zone.

By deploying across multiple zones you can also take advantage of server pools and origins, which are part of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.cis_short}}. Server pools and origins allows DevOps to integrate, validate and deploy new software features. **More information is covered in a later section of this document.**

## Scenario 3 - deploying in multiple zones with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.loadbalancer_short}}

You can also deploy your application in multiple zones using only {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.loadbalancer_short}} rather than a combination of {{site.data.keyword.cis_full_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.loadbalancer_short}}. This deployment scenario is less ideal, but is more cost-effective. You should only consider this method for less critical and less sensitive applications, such as internal applications.
