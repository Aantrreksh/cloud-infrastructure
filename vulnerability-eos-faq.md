# FAQs: Nessus end of service
{: #monitoring-faq-2}

## When and why is the Nessus Vulnerability Assessment & Reporting service being deprecated? 
{: faq1}

IBM Cloud's license expires 19 July 2020 and is not being renewed. After this date, you cannot conduct any vulnerability scans from the Nessus Security Scanner within the IBM Cloud console. 

## Can I continue to access previous scans through the IBM Cloud console? 
{: faq2}

Yes, previous scans will continue to be available in the portal for some period of time. However, it is recommended that you capture any previous scans that are required for your records. 

To ensure you do not have any gaps in your vulnerability scans, it is recommended that you select a replacement vulnerability scanning service of your choice before 19 July 2020. 

## Is there a transition product within IBM Cloud that you can migrate to?
{: faq3}

Currently, there is no transition plan or product recommendation to which to migrate.
