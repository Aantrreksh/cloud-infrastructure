# FAQs: Nessus end of service
{: #monitoring-faq-2}

## When and why is the Nessus Vulnerability Assessment & Reporting service being deprecated? 
{: faq1}

The Nessus Vulnerability Assessment & Reporting lincese for IBM Cloud expires 19 July 2020 and isn't being renewed. After this date, you can't conduct any vulnerability scans from the Nessus Security Scanner within the IBM Cloud console. 

## Can I continue to access previous scans through the IBM Cloud console? 
{: faq2}

Yes, previous scans continue to be available in the portal for some period. However, it is recommended that you capture any previous scans that are required for your records. 

To make sure that you don't have any gaps in your vulnerability scans, you need to select a replacement vulnerability scanning service of your choice before 19 July 2020. 

## Is there a transition product within IBM Cloud that you can migrate to?
{: faq3}

Currently, no transition plan or product recommendation exists.
