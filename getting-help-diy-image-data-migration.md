# Getting help and support for image and data migration
{: #getting-help-support-image-data-migration}

If you have problems or questions when running the scripts to migrate data or images to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, you can create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/vpc-migration-tools){: external} or send an email to [wes-migration-support@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com](mailto:wes-migration-support@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com). Keep in mind that since the scripts are available on an open source tool, an SLA wonâ€™t be assigned to your GitHub issue or email.  

If you have problems or questions when using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure, you can get help by searching for information or by asking questions through one of the forums. You can also create a case in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}. 

See [Getting help](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-using-avatar#using-avatar) for more details about using the forums. 

For information about opening an IBM support ticket, see [Contacting support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-using-avatar).
